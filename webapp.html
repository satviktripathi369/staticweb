                The full form of Html is Hyper Text Markup Language.
                html waas made in 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee and was official in 1999
                The HTML has many tags and can be divided into 3 parts -: semantic, structural and formatting.
                The heading tag is from h1 to h7 and after thatany heading tag is treated as a paragh tag.
                The font and boldness gets less from h1 to h7.
                Between the two html tags anything thats written is called content and the whole thing is called
                element.The current specification is known as the HTML Living
                Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major
                browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the
                Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group
                (WHATWG)
                Links –These mark a hyperlink around link text. When click by
                user, browser loads the page in the HREF attribute.
                Target attribute, indicates which window/tab should be used
                for the linked page
                target=“_self ” – Default. Place the content in the current tab
                target=“_blank” – Place the content in a newly created tab.
                <IMG> -Will display an image
                Image file must be in a popular graphics format (gif, jpg, png, etc)
                Format :
                IMG src=“url for image file” width=#, height=#, alt=“Text to display
                Semantic tags are for putting content in the page.
                Stucture tags aren to add some base to the page.
                Formatting tags are used for some styling in the page.
